🚀 Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
Node.js (version 18 or higher is recommended)

npm (comes with Node.js)

Installation & Setup
**Clone the repository:**bash git clone https://github.com/your-username/ba-studio.git cd ba-studio


Install dependencies:

Bash

npm install
Set up environment variables:

Create a new file named .env in the root of the project.

Add your Google Gemini API key to this file:

GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
Important: The .env file contains sensitive credentials and should never be committed to version control. Ensure that .env is listed in your .gitignore file.

Run the development server:

Bash

npm run dev
The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

☁️ Deployment
This project is configured for seamless deployment to Netlify.

Connect your repository to Netlify:

Push your code to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

In the Netlify dashboard, create a "New site from Git" and select your repository.

Configure build settings:

Netlify should automatically detect the settings from the netlify.toml file:

Build command: npm run build

Publish directory: dist

Functions directory: netlify/functions

Add environment variables:

In your Netlify site's settings, go to Site configuration > Environment variables.

Add a new variable with the key GEMINI_API_KEY and paste your secret API key as the value. This ensures your key is securely available to the serverless function in the production environment.

Deploy:

Trigger a deploy. Netlify will build the project and deploy the site and serverless functions.

# Optimize Asset Loading and Performance

## Overview
Implement asset optimization strategies for improved performance and user experience, particularly focusing on the logo images and other static assets.

## Proposed Changes
1. Configure Vite's asset handling:
   - [ ] Enable image optimization/compression
   - [ ] Add WebP conversion for modern browsers
   - [ ] Configure optimal public paths for assets

2. Implement responsive images:
   - [ ] Add multiple image sizes for different viewport widths
   - [ ] Use `srcset` and `sizes` attributes for optimal loading
   - [ ] Consider lazy loading for non-critical images

3. Performance optimizations:
   - [ ] Add preload hints for critical assets
   - [ ] Configure appropriate cache headers
   - [ ] Set up Content-Security-Policy headers for assets

## Technical Details
- Use Vite's built-in asset optimization features
- Consider adding plugins like `vite-plugin-image-optimizer`
- Implement proper TypeScript types for optimized assets
- Add build-time optimization steps

## Success Criteria
- Improved Lighthouse performance scores
- Reduced initial load time
- Smaller asset bundle sizes
- Maintained image quality at reduced file sizes

- Current implementation in `components/icons.tsx`
- Asset types in `src/types/images.d.ts`
- Vite configuration in `vite.config.ts`

## Notes
- Consider browser support requirements
- Test performance impact on different network conditions
- Document optimization settings for team reference
